## Description

Static members that initialize with other static members depend on document order.

## Motivation

A static field or property initialized with another must be declared after.

```cs
public class Foo
{
    public static readonly int Value1 = Value2;

    public static readonly int Value2 = 2;
}
```

In the above example `Value1` will be initialized with `0` which is likely not the intention.

## How to fix violations

Declare members with dependencies in correct order.

```cs
public class Foo
{
    public static readonly int Value2 = 2;

    public static readonly int Value1 = Value2;
}
```

## Configure severity

### Via ruleset file.

Configure the severity per project, for more info see [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264949.aspx).

### Via #pragma directive.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0023 // Static members that initialize with other static members depend on document order.
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GU0023 // Static members that initialize with other static members depend on document order.
```

Or put this at the top of the file to disable all instances.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0023 // Static members that initialize with other static members depend on document order.
```

### Via attribute `[SuppressMessage]`.

```C#
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Gu.Analyzers.Correctness", 
    "GU0023:Static members that initialize with other static members depend on document order.", 
    Justification = "Reason...")]
```
